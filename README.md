# Audio Processing Project

This project contains a set of C++ programs for audio analysis and processing, developed using the **libsndfile** library.
It includes tools to copy, compare, compress, quantize, generate histograms, and apply various audio effects to WAV files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

Before building, make sure **libsndfile** is installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
```

Then build the executables:

```bash
cd sndfile-example/src
make
cd ../..
```

All binaries will be available inside `sndfile-example/bin`.

## üß™ Testing

This section describes how to test each executable program included in the project.
Each subsection corresponds to a specific binary located in the `sndfile-example/bin` directory.

---

### üîπ wav_cp

Copies the contents of one WAV file to another.

```bash
../bin/wav_cp <input-file.wav> <output-file.wav>
```

This command duplicates the input audio file and writes the copy to the specified output file.

---

### üîπ wav_cmp

Compares two WAV files to analyze differences in their audio data.

```bash
../bin/wav_cmp <file1.wav> <file2.wav> [options]
```

Optional flags such as `-v` (verbose) can be used to display detailed comparison results.

---

### üîπ wav_dct

Applies block DCT per channel and keeps only a fraction of low-frequency coefficients, reconstructing a lossy WAV.

Usage:

```bash
../bin/wav_dct [ -v ] [ -bs blockSize ] [ -frac dctFraction ] <input.wav> <output.wav>
```

Works with mono or stereo PCM_16 WAV.
It outputs a WAV with high-frequency content reduced. File size remains similar to the input.

---

### üîπ wav_quant

Uniformly quantizes PCM samples to a target bit depth and writes a new WAV (container stays 16‚Äëbit PCM).

Usage:

```bash
../bin/wav_quant [ -v ] -b <bits:1..16> <input.wav> <output.wav>
```

Input must be WAV PCM_16; output remains PCM_16 but amplitudes are snapped to 2^bits levels.
Assess distortion with `../bin/wav_cmp sample.wav q8.wav`.

---

### üîπ wav_hist

Generates histograms for one or more channels of a WAV file, including mono, stereo, mid, and side representations.
Results can be redirected to a text file for visualization.

```bash
../bin/wav_hist <input-file.wav> <channel|mid|side> [bin-size] > <output-histogram>.txt
```

To visualize the histogram:

```bash
python3 test/plot_hist.py data/<output-histogram>.txt
```

This allows you to analyze amplitude distributions and compare how bin size affects histogram coarseness.

---

### üîπ wav_effects

Applies various audio effects such as echo, multiple echoes, amplitude modulation (tremolo), and vibrato (time-varying delay).

```bash
../bin/wav_effects <effect> <input-file.wav> <output-file.wav> [parameters...]
```

Where:

* `<effect>`: `echo`, `multiecho`, `tremolo`, or `vib`
* `<input-file.wav>`: source audio file
* `<output-file.wav>`: resulting file with the effect applied
* `[parameters...]`: effect-specific parameters such as delay, decay, modulation frequency, or depth

Each effect processes the input audio signal to create unique auditory transformations.

### üîπ wav_quant_dec

### üîπ dct_enc

Lossy encoder for mono WAV based on block DCT + quantization. Writes a compact `.dct` bitstream using BitStream.

Usage:

```bash
../bin/dct_enc [ -v ] [ -bs N ] [ -k K ] [ -b bits ] [ -q step ] <input_mono.wav> <output.dct>
```

Input must be mono PCM_16 WAV. Use `wav_to_mono` to downmix.
Tune quality/size: increase `-k` (keep more DCT coeffs) and/or decrease `-q` (finer quantization) for higher quality; ensure `-b` is large enough to avoid coefficient clipping (e.g., 14‚Äì16).

---

### üîπ dct_dec

Decoder for `.dct` files produced by `dct_enc`. Reconstructs a mono PCM_16 WAV via inverse DCT.

Usage:

```bash
../bin/dct_dec [ -v ] <input.dct> <output.wav>
```

---

## üìä Histogram Visualization

A Python script is provided to visualize histograms generated by the C++ histogram tool, enabling easier analysis of channel distributions or quantization effects.

### Set up Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example Usage

```bash
cd sndfile-example
./bin/wav_hist <input-file.wav> <channel|mid|side> <bin-size> > ./data/<output-histogram>.txt
python3 test/plot_hist.py data/<output-histogram>.txt
```

This workflow computes and plots the histogram of the selected audio channel using the specified bin size. The resulting plot provides a visual interpretation of the audio signal‚Äôs amplitude distribution.

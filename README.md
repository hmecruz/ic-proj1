# Audio Processing Project

This project contains a set of C++ programs for audio analysis and processing, developed using the **libsndfile** library.
It includes tools to copy, compare, compress, quantize, generate histograms, and apply various audio effects to WAV files.

### Main Executables

| Executable    | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wav_cp`      | Copies a WAV file                                               |
| `wav_cmp`     | Compares two WAV files                                          |
| `wav_dct`     | Applies DCT-based compression                                   |
| `wav_quant`   | Performs audio quantization (encoding/decoding)                 |
| `wav_hist`    | Generates and saves histograms for audio channels               |
| `wav_effects` | Applies audio effects (echo, multiple echoes, tremolo, vibrato) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

Before building, make sure **libsndfile** is installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
```

Then build the executables:

```bash
cd sndfile-example/src
make
cd ../..
```

All binaries will be available inside `sndfile-example/bin`.

## üß™ Testing

This section describes how to test each executable program included in the project.
Each subsection corresponds to a specific binary located in the `sndfile-example/bin` directory.

---

### üîπ wav_cp

Copies the contents of one WAV file to another.

```bash
../bin/wav_cp <input-file.wav> <output-file.wav>
```

This command duplicates the input audio file and writes the copy to the specified output file.

---

### üîπ wav_cmp

Compares two WAV files to analyze differences in their audio data.

```bash
../bin/wav_cmp <file1.wav> <file2.wav> [options]
```

Optional flags such as `-v` (verbose) can be used to display detailed comparison results.

### üîπ wav_quant

### üîπ wav_hist

Generates histograms for one or more channels of a WAV file, including mono, stereo, mid, and side representations.
Results can be redirected to a text file for visualization.

```bash
../bin/wav_hist <input-file.wav> <channel|mid|side> [bin-size] > <output-histogram>.txt
```

To visualize the histogram:

```bash
python3 test/plot_hist.py data/<output-histogram>.txt
```

This allows you to analyze amplitude distributions and compare how bin size affects histogram coarseness.

---

### üîπ wav_effects

Applies various audio effects such as echo, multiple echoes, amplitude modulation (tremolo), and vibrato (time-varying delay).

```bash
../bin/wav_effects <effect> <input-file.wav> <output-file.wav> [parameters...]
```

Where:

* `<effect>`: `echo`, `multiecho`, `tremolo`, or `vib`
* `<input-file.wav>`: source audio file
* `<output-file.wav>`: resulting file with the effect applied
* `[parameters...]`: effect-specific parameters such as delay, decay, modulation frequency, or depth

Each effect processes the input audio signal to create unique auditory transformations.

### üîπ wav_quant_dec

## üìä Histogram Visualization

A Python script is provided to visualize histograms generated by the C++ histogram tool, enabling easier analysis of channel distributions or quantization effects.

### Set up Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example Usage

```bash
cd sndfile-example
./bin/wav_hist <input-file.wav> <channel|mid|side> <bin-size> > ./data/<output-histogram>.txt
python3 test/plot_hist.py data/<output-histogram>.txt
```

This workflow computes and plots the histogram of the selected audio channel using the specified bin size. The resulting plot provides a visual interpretation of the audio signal‚Äôs amplitude distribution.
